I always wanted to start my personal blogging website where I can share my ideas easily. Also it is not that I am a regular blogger and want to earn from the same.
But wanted a personal space where I can share my thoughts and learning processes easily with others over internet.
I have tried other blogging platforms like medium and wordpress thought they are very good and easy to use i always wanted to have something of my own which I can host on my personal web address :).

## Things I expect from my blogging site

1. Writing blog should be as simple as wiriting a text document, did not wanted to spend time on formatting and styling it.
2. Should be flexible enough which allowed me to add custom components like an animation or a web example if needed.
3. Wanted an [.MD](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/) based blog format as I find it simple to use.

## What does this blogging starter provide

* An markdown based blog writing prestyled site. which can be used as it is or can be curated as per ones need by changing few CSS or components in the post-wrapper component.
* Since it is MD based all the fomatting supported with a .md file are supported.
* This specifically uses [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) which allows you to use JSX in your markdown content.[^JSX] This makes writing long-form content with components a blast. ðŸš€

[^JSX]:
    You can import components, such as interactive charts or alerts, and embed them within your content.
